# Sierra Demo Video Script

## Video Overview
**Duration**: 3-5 minutes
**Tone**: Professional, technical, engaging

---

## Scene 1: Opening (0:00 - 0:30)

**[VISUAL]**
- Dark screen with Sierra logo fade-in
- Animated mountain peak graphic

**[AUDIO - VOICEOVER]**
"Meet Sierra. A high-performance Merkle proof generation and verification system built for speed."

**[VISUAL]**
- Quick montage: Code scrolling, benchmark numbers, system architecture diagram

---

## Scene 2: Problem Statement (0:30 - 1:00)

**[VISUAL]**
- Split screen: Traditional systems vs Sierra
- Show slow proof generation vs fast proof generation

**[AUDIO - VOICEOVER]**
"Traditional Merkle proof systems struggle with large datasets. Sierra changes that. With optimized algorithms and RISC-V architecture support, we're setting new performance standards."

---

## Scene 3: Core Features (1:00 - 2:00)

**[VISUAL]**
- Web interface homepage showing Sierra branding with logo

**[AUDIO - VOICEOVER]**
"Sierra delivers four key capabilities:"

**[VISUAL]**
- Feature 1 animation: Lightning bolt icon, "Merkle Proof Generation"

**[AUDIO - VOICEOVER]**
"First, lightning-fast Merkle proof generation for datasets with over one million leaves."

**[VISUAL]**
- Feature 2 animation: Shield check icon, "Proof Verification"

**[AUDIO - VOICEOVER]**
"Second, optimized verification with minimal computational overhead."

**[VISUAL]**
- Feature 3 animation: CPU chip icon, "RISC-V Optimizations"

**[AUDIO - VOICEOVER]**
"Third, assembly-level optimizations specifically designed for RISC-V architecture."

**[VISUAL]**
- Feature 4 animation: API connection icon, "SPI Interface"

**[AUDIO - VOICEOVER]**
"And fourth, a clean SPI interface for seamless proof submission and verification."

## Scene 4: Performance Demo (2:00 - 3:00)

**[VISUAL]**
- Screen recording of web interface
- Navigate through sections:
  - Architecture page showing system design
  - Code page showing source structure
  - Benchmarks page showing performance metrics

**[AUDIO - VOICEOVER]**
"Let's see Sierra in action. Our web interface provides easy access to documentation, source code, and real-time performance benchmarks."

**[VISUAL]**
- Highlight performance stats on screen:
  - Proof Generation: < 100ms
  - Proof Verification: < 50ms
  - Memory Usage: < 100MB
  - Cache Efficiency: > 90%

**[AUDIO - VOICEOVER]**
"Behind these numbers is a carefully optimized codebase, featuring efficient memory management, cache-aware algorithms, and RISC-V vector extensions."

---

## Scene 5: Project Structure (3:00 - 3:30)

**[VISUAL]**
- File tree animation showing project organization

**[AUDIO - VOICEOVER]**
"Sierra is organized for performance and maintainability. The core module handles Merkle tree operations, while hash functions are implemented in SHA-256 and Blake2b. Our SPI interface provides a clean API for integration, and comprehensive tests ensure correctness."

---

## Scene 6: Use Cases (3:30 - 4:00)

**[VISUAL]**
- Icons representing each use case

**[AUDIO - VOICEOVER]**
"Sierra is ideal for blockchain scalability solutions, data availability proofs, decentralized storage systems, and audit compliance verification."

---

## Scene 7: Closing (4:00 - 4:30)

**[VISUAL]**
- Sierra logo centered
- Tagline appears: "High-Performance Merkle Proof System"

**[AUDIO - VOICEOVER]**
"Sierra. Performance where it matters."

**[VISUAL]**
- Fade to black with:
  - GitHub link (optional)
  - Contact information (optional)
  - "Learn more at [documentation link]"

## Production Notes

### Graphics Needed
1. Sierra logo (SVG provided in `/public/logo.svg`)
2. Mountain peak animated graphic
3. Feature icons (lightning, shield, CPU, API)
4. Performance metric cards
5. File tree animation
6. System architecture diagram

### B-Roll Footage
- Screen recordings of:
  - Web interface navigation
  - Code browsing
